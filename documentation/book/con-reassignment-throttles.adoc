= Reassignment throttles

Reassigning partitions can be a slow process because it can require moving lots of data between brokers.
To avoid this having a detrimental impact on clients it is possible to _throttle_ the reassignment.
Using a throttle can mean the reassignment takes longer.
If the throttle is too low then the newly assigned brokers will not be able to keep up with records being published and the reassignment will never complete.
If the throttle is too high then clients will be impacted.
For example, for producers, this could manifest as higher than normal latency waiting for acknowledgement. For consumers, this could manifest as a drop in throughput caused by higher latency between polls.
