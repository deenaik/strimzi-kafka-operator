= Scaling Kafka clusters

== Adding brokers to a cluster

The primary way of increasing throughput for a topic is to increase the number of partitions for that topic. 
That works because the partitions allow the load for that topic to be shared between the brokers in the cluster.
When the brokers are all constrained by some resource (typically I/O), then using more partitions will not yield an increase in throughput.
Instead, you must add brokers to the cluster.

When you add an extra broker to the cluster, Kafka does not assign any partitions to it automatically.
You have to decide which partitions to move from the existing brokers to the new broker.

Once the partitions have been redistributed between all brokers, each broker should have a lower resource utilization.

== Removing brokers from the cluster

Because {ProductName} uses `StatefulSets` to manage the broker pods you cannot remove _any_ pod from the cluster. You can only remove the highest numbered pod(s) from the cluster.

Before you remove a broker from a cluster, you must ensure that it is not assigned to any partitions.
You should decide which remaining brokers will be responsible for each of the partitions on the broker being decommissioned.
Once the broker has no assigned partitions, you can stop it.
