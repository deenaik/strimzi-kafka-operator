= Reassignment of partitions

The Topic Operator does not currently support reassigning replicas to different brokers, so it is necessary to connect directly to broker pods to reassign replicas to brokers.

Within a broker pod the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` utility is used to reassign partitions to different brokers.

It has three different modes:

`--generate`::
Takes a set of topics and brokers and generates a _reassignment JSON file_ which will result in the partitions of those topics being assigned to those brokers.
It is an easy way to generate a _reassignment JSON Because {ProductName} uses `StatefulSets` to manage the broker pods you cannot remove _any_ pod from the cluster. You can only remove the highest numbered pod(s) from the cluster.file_, but it operates on whole topics, so its use is not always appropriate.

`--execute`::
Takes a _reassignment JSON file_ and applies it to the partitions and brokers in the cluster.
Brokers which are gaining partitions will become followers of the partition leader.
For a given partition, once the new broker has caught up and joined the ISR the old broker will stop being a follower and will delete its replica.

`--verify`::
Using the same _reassignment JSON file_ as the `--execute` step, `--verify` checks whether all of the partitions in the file have been moved to their intended brokers.
If the reassignment is complete it will also remove any xref:con-reassignment-throttles-{context}[throttles] which are in effect.
Unless removed, throttles will continue to affect the cluster even after the reassignment has finished.

It is only possible to have one reassignment running in the cluster at any given time, and it is not possible to cancel a running reassignment.
If you need to cancel a reassignment you have to wait for it to complete and then perform another reassignment to revert the effects of the first one.
The `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` will print the reassignment JSON for this reversion as part of its output.
Very large reassignments should be broken down into a number of smaller reassignments in case there is a need to stop in-progress reassignment.

== Reassignment JSON file

The _reassignment JSON file_ has a specific structure:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "partitions": [
    _<PartitionObjects>_
  ]
}
----

Where _<PartitionObjects>_ is a comma-separated list of objects like:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
{
  "topic": _<TopicName>_,
  "partition": _<Partition>_,
  "replicas": [ _<AssignedBrokerIds>_ ]
}
----

NOTE: Although Kafka also supports a `"log_dirs"` property this should not be used in {ProductLongName}.

The following is an example reassignment JSON file that assigns topic `topic-a`, partition `4` to brokers `2`, `4` and `7`, and topic `topic-b` partition `2` to brokers `1`, `5` and `7`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "partitions": [
    {
      "topic": "topic-a",
      "partition": 4,
      "replicas": [2,4,7]
    },
    {
      "topic": "topic-b",
      "partition": 2,
      "replicas": [1,5,7]
    }
  ]
}
----

Partitions not included in the JSON are not changed.

== Generating reassignment JSON files

The easiest way to assign all the partitions for a given set of topics to a given set of brokers is to generate a reassignment JSON file using the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --generate` command within a broker pod.

ifdef::Kubernetes[]
On {KubernetesName}:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl exec _<BrokerPod>_ -c kafka -it -- bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topics-to-move-json-file _<TopicsFile>_ --broker-list _<BrokerList>_ --generate
----
endif::Kubernetes[]

On {OpenShiftName}:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
oc rsh _<BrokerPod>_ -c kafka bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topics-to-move-json-file _<TopicsFile>_ --broker-list _<BrokerList>_ --generate
----

The `_<TopicsFile>_` is a JSON file which lists the topics to move. 
It has the following structure:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "topics": [
    _<TopicObjects>_
  ]
}
----

where _<TopicObjects>_ is a comma-separated list of objects like:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
{
  "topic": _<TopicName>_
}
----

For example to move all the partitions of `topic-a` and `topic-b` to brokers `4` and `7`

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topics-to-move-json-file topics-to-be-moved.json --broker-list 4,7 --generate
----

where `topics-to-be-moved.json` has contents:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "topics": [
    { "topic": "topic-a"},
    { "topic": "topic-b"}
  ]
}
----

== Creating reassignment JSON files manually

You can manually create the reassignment JSON file if you want to move specific partitions.
